Regular exercise is **essential** for maintaining good physical and mental health.

Firstly, exercise improves _cardiovascular health_ by increasing heart rate and strengthening the heart muscle. It also helps control weight by burning calories and boosting metabolism.

Moreover, regular exercise enhances mood and reduces stress levels by stimulating the production of endorphins, known as `feel-good` hormones.
